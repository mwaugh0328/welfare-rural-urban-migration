This is a basic read me file for "The Welfare Effects of Encouraging Rural-Urban Migration" 

The best way to work with this is to visit the online code repository at:

https://github.com/mwaugh0328/welfare-rural-urban-migration

which has everything in this folder with interactive README.md files.

To work with this locally, the README.md files provide an overview of each folder.

.md files are "markdown" format and Visual Studio is one way to view them (at text editor will work too)
