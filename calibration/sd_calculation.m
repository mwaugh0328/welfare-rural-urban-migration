%Standard Errors Calculation and Elasticity Matrix for LMW 2019 ECMA  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Here is the code that generates the standard errors and the elasticity matrix. 
%
% Basic idea is take in the parmeters. We should have 9 parameters. The
% "compute_outcome_prefshock" file will pop out 11 moments. 
% We change the parameters by a small amount. 
% Record the change in the moments relative to the change in the parameters. 
%
% Then after that we can reorder the "table" as we want.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   
%%%%%% Elasticities for parameters with respect to Moments
% order of moments from compute_outcome.m is:
% cons_growth P_noassets mig_rate cons_gainols  mig_inc  mig_inc_y2 cons_gainlate wage_gap p_rural var_logwage 
% order of parameters: 
% order_table = [2,5,6,7,8,3,1,4,9]=[theta,ubar,lambda,pi_prob,gamma,A_u,sigma_s,rho,sigma_nu // sigma_rc, sigma_ui]
% order_moments: 
% 1- Wage gap
% 2- The rural share
% 3- The urban variance... note that this is position number 3 (see below)
% 4- Fraction with no liquid assets
% 5- seasonal migration in control
% 6- increase in r1 (22 percent)
% 7- increase in r2 (9.2 percent)
% 8- LATE estiamte
% 9- OLS estimate
% 10- mig_cond_mig
% 11- Standard deviation of consumption growth. 
% Therefore, order_moments = [11, 4, 5, 9, 6, 7, 8, 10, 1, 2, 3];
%    =[cons_growth P_noassets mig_rate cons_gainols  mig_inc  mig_inc_y2 cons_gainlate mig_cond_mig wage_gap p_rural var_logwage ];
