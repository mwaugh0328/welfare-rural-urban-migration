% Here is the code that generated the "indentification table" that we had
% in the paper. 
%
% Basic idea is take int he parmeters. We should have 8 parameters. The
% calibration will pop out 10 moments. Change the parameters by a small
% amount. Record the change in the moments relative to the change in the
% parameters. Everything below is done in logs.
%
% Then after that we can reorder the "table" as we want...

% not changing that much, this is a question of how accuratly we are
% solving it, here is an area of investigation.

    els_moments(xxx,:) = change_moments'./change_cal % compute change.
